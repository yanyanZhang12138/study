#simple code
void rec(int x){
	for(int i=0; i<x; ++i)

#In this particular program the recursive function rec() always call itself before reaching the end of the for loop at the current level of depth. the function call itself at parameter i = 0 which becomes the parameter c in the next level of recursion. once the condition of the for loop is not true any more (where x = 0), let's say we are at level of depth n in the recursion tree, the program continues it's flow back at level n - 1 and call rec() with parameter i of vlaue i(n-1) + 1.
